---=================================---


Welcome to xpcrypt! This program will decrypt and encrypt cheat codes and ROMs
for Xploder PSX.


---============---
   Version history
---===============---

v1.1 (May 1 2009)
* Rewrote most of xpcrypt.
* Support decryption/encryption of Xploder ROMs.
* Upgrade to GPL v3.
* Use CMake as build system.
* Fix the disclaimer.

v1.0 (Jul 4 2007)
* Initial public release

   About xpcrypt
---=============---

Even though I cracked the Xploder code encryption many years ago, I never
released an actual crypto program publicly. (I only put out the reverse-
engineered crypto routines but nobody used them to develop a program.)

However, here is xpcrypt, a simple console application which allows you to
decrypt or encrypt Xploder codes for PSX. Feel free to write a more
sophisticated tool. ;)


---==---
   Build
---=====---

To compile xpcrypt, you need CMake and a working C compiler like gcc.
I recommend doing an out-of-source build:
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src/
$ make

To install xpcrypt:
# make install


---==---
   Usage
---=====---

Usage: xpcrypt [options] [input file] [output file]

Options are:
 -d/--decrypt-codes        decrypt codes (default)
 -e/--encrypt-codes <key>  encrypt codes with key [4,5,6,7]
 -r/--decrypt-rom          decrypt ROM
 -R/--encrypt-rom          encrypt ROM
 -h/--help                 display this information
 -v/--version              display the version of xpcrypt

By default, xpcrypt reads codes from stdin, decrypts them, and writes them to
stdout (-d option). Use the -e option together with an encryption key if you
want to encrypt codes instead. Valid keys are 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Make use of redirects to read codes from (<) or write them to text files (>).

Further, you can decrypt (-r) or encrypt (-R) Xploder ROMs. Simply pass the
respective option plus input and output file to xpcrypt.

   Samples
---=======---

Decrypt some codes:
$ ./xpcrypt
76621A3E 5450 ; input four encrypted codes
865895E6 8D5A
96621A3E 5450
865895E6 659A
700CC7EA FBFE ; decrypted codes start here
80024292 3C00
900CC7EA FBFE
80024292 1440

Encrypt a code with key 7:
$ ./xpcrypt -e 7
3001F012 00A0
377EB8E8 15D5

Decrypt codes from text file foo.txt and print them to the screen:
$ ./xpcrypt < foo.txt
...

Decrypt codes from foo.txt and write them to bar.txt:
$ ./xpcrypt < foo.txt > bar.txt

Decrypt ROM foo.bin to bar.bin:
$ ./xpcrypt -r foo.bin bar.bin
